<!-- Dear team, -->
<!-- Today, we received some data from a PhD student from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. She has been collecting data over the past 2 years on a small subset of kids submitted to neonatology. Her supervisor has requested you to look at some of the following: -->

<!--   - outcome of delivery (baby is okay and if baby was admitted to nenotolagy) -->
<!--   - malaria during pregnancy -->
<!--   - weight, height and apgar -->
<!--   - completeness of variables -->
<!--   - numbers of variables -->
<!--   - the mean age of women -->
<!--   - number of kids submitted to icu/neonatology -->
<!--   - who went to clinic and who did not go to clinic -->
<!--   - how many had a single or double or triple delivery -->
<!--   - mean birth weight and height and range & mean apgar and range -->
<!--   - difference time of when delivery was made (day vs. night) -->

<!-- Overall, the client has requested a neonatology descriptive paper. Please send me an update once a week so that I can see how you are progressing, but I am excited to see the final product in 4 weeks time.  -->
<!-- Many thanks, -->
<!-- Your super cool and suave boss -->
